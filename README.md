## About me

After working for over 25 years in media working in various roles within digital product development, in 2019 I changed career to focus on software engineering.

I focus on front end and full stack JavaScript development, using React for the user interface.

## About this site

This is the third incarnation of my porfolio site. All three have used React, but inspired by [Web Bos](https://wesbos.com/), I decided to give [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) a try. I also wanted to make my site more than a single scrollable page. So I've used [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) as a simple way to write and deliver some posts.
