## Cocktail DB API - React project
This was a pair-coding, hackathon project with [Aiman Mallah](https://github.com/aimanmallah) at General Assembly.

The brief was to:
* Consume a publicly available API
* Deliver the data back in a React app

The project consumes data from [CocktailDB API](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php).

The site can be run locally by cloning the repository and typing ```npm i``` and then ```npm run serve``` in the terminal.

### App overview

The application allows a user to search for a cocktail by single ingredient or name of the cocktail, returning the results under the search input.

Clicking on a cocktail provides information on the ingredients and instructions on how to make the cocktail.

Similar cocktails are displayed under each cocktail. This filter is based on the ingredients of the cocktail on display.

### Development process

Three endpoints were chosen:

* [Filter by ingredient](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?i=Gin)
* [Search by name](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/search.php?s=margarita)
* [Random cocktail](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/random.php)

The main page is rendered from four components ```Home.js```, ```NavBar.js```, ```RandomCocktail.js``` and ```CocktailIndex.js```.

Choosing from the radio buttons (ingredient or name) sets a search variable which was appended to the api call. A ternary operator allowed us to refactor the code to a simple statement and ```scrollIntoView``` was used on submit to maximise the number of results on the page:

```jsx
handleSubmit(e) {
  e.preventDefault()
  const endpoint = this.state.filter === 'ingredient' ? 'filter.php?i' : 'search.php?s'

  axios.get(`https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/${endpoint}=${this.state.search.searchInput}`)
    .then(res => this.setState({ data: res.data }))
    .then(() => this.searchResultsSection.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth', block: 'start' }))
}
```

#### Cocktail detail page

The delivery of the ingredients was a challenge because the data from the API was unstructured with many empty or null values, and the drinks and measures separated in to different key: value pairs.

This was resolved by filtering the response data:

```jsx
getData(){
  axios.get('https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/lookup.php', {
    params: {
      i: this.props.match.params.id
    }
  })
    .then(res => {
      const data = res.data.drinks[0]

      const drinks = Object.keys(data)
        .filter(key => key.match(/ingredient/i))
        .filter(key => !!data[key] || data[key] === ' ')
        .map(key => data[key].trim())

      const measures = Object.keys(data)
        .filter(key => key.match(/measure/i))
        .filter(key => !!data[key] || data[key] === ' ')
        .map(key => data[key].trim())

      const ingredients = drinks.map((drink, index) => {
        return { drink: drinks[index], measure: measures[index] }
      })

      const cocktail = {
        image: data.strDrinkThumb,
        name: data.strDrink,
        instructions: data.strInstructions,
        glass: data.strGlass,
        alcoholic: data.strAlcoholic,
        category: data.strCategory,
        id: data.idDrink,
        ingredients
      }

      this.setState({ cocktail })
    })
}
```

##### Similar cocktails

The similar cocktails component was created by randomly choosing an ingredient from the cocktail on show and using this ingredient to make another API call.

```jsx
getData(){
  const randomIngredient = this.props.ingredients[Math.floor(Math.random() * this.props.ingredients.length)]

  axios.get('https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php', {
    params: {
      i: randomIngredient.drink
    }
  })
    .then(res => {
      const drinks = res.data.drinks.slice(0,5)
      this.setState({ data: drinks })
    })
}
```

### Future enhancements
* Upgrading the API to allow searches by multiple ingredients.
* Adding failed search notifications.
