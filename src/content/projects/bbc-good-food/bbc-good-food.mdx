When I joined Immediate Media as a junior UI developer, I was lucky enough to work on the migration of [BBC Good Food](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com) on to our in-house platform.

Immediate Media had developed Fabric, a shared platform for 25 brands built around WordPress and Twig, a templating language for WordPress. However, with millions of unique visitors every month and unique requirements, BBC Good Food required a reimagining of the tech stack to support such high content demands.

## React and Nextjs
At it's heart, the build of Fabric 2.0 took the current custom WordPress content management system and introduced a headless front end utilising React and Nextjs. Whilst also migrating millions of users and thousands of great recipes.

## Component library
We followed [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) principles to build a component library within a monorepo we call patchwork.

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) was used to visualise the components. I would recommend using Storybook for any large project. Not only does it make local development so much easier, it provides context for each tech team, and a resource for UX and business stakeholders.

## NPM packages
We developed our own private package library within NPM. I had a chance to contribute to this library, writing new packages for delivery of advertising scripts and automatically pushing build notes to [Speedcurve](https://speedcurve.com/), a performance monitoring system.

## Testing
I had done a bit of testing using Mocha and Chai, but not much! We were committed to delivering high percentage coverage with unit tests through [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), [Enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/), [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro) and [React Hooks Testing Library](https://react-hooks-testing-library.com/).

A steep learning curve, but great fun once you get the hang of it!

We were also asked to support our webops team by contributing to setting up our load testing using [Artillery.io](https://artillery.io/).

## In at the deep end
Working on the migration of BBC Good Food was an amazing start to my new career as a software engineer. Whilst a bit daunting at times and a steep learning, working on build of this scale allowed me to touch many different areas and set a foundation for growth.
