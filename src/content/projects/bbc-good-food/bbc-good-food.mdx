When I joined Immediate Media as a junior UI developer, I was lucky enough to work on the migration of [BBC Good Food](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com) on to our in-house platform.

Immediate Media had developed Fabric, a shared platform for 25 brands. However, with millions of unique visitors every month and unique requirements, BBC Good Food required a reimagining of the tech stack to support such high content demands.

## React and Nextjs
At it's heart, the build of Fabric 2.0 took the current custom WordPress content management system and introduced a headless front end utilising React and Nextjs. Whilst also migrating millions of users and thousands of great recipes.

## Component library
We followed [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) principles to build a component library within a monorepo we call patchwork.

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) was used to visualise the components. I would recommend using Storybook for any large project. Not only does it make local development so much easier, it provides context for each tech team, and a resource for UX and business stakeholders.

## NPM packages
We developed our own private package library within NPM. I had a chance to contribute to this library, writing new packages for delivery of advertising scripts and automatically pushing build notes to [Speedcurve](https://speedcurve.com/), a performance monitoring system.

## Testing
I had done a bit of testing using Mocha and Chai, but not much!. We were committed to delivering high percentage coverage with unit tests through [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), [Enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/), [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro) and [React Hooks Testing Library](https://react-hooks-testing-library.com/).

A steep learning curve, but great fun once you get the hang of it!

We were also asked to support our webops team by contributing to setting up our load testing using [Artillery.io](https://artillery.io/).

## Baptism of fire
We are always learning and I learn something new every day. But whilst working on such a big project in my first full time developer role was daunting at times, the 'in at the deep end' process pushed me forward so quickly.
