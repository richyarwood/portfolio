Working in the tech and education industry for more than 10 years, I started to learn programming in my own time, whilst managing a small team of developers. I discovered that programming excited me and I wanted to learn more. This soon turned into a desire to pursue this as a new career and I enrolled on an immersive software engineering course with General Assembly.

The GA software engineering immersive course provided me with the launchpad I needed to turn my previous experience in to the practical skills needed to be a junior web developer.

As well as learning new languages and enhancing my abilities to problem-solve, I learned to work collaboratively, whether via code-pairing or a single repository as part of a team.

As a graduate from GA, I am excited to combine my previous work experience with a solid foundation in software engineering.
